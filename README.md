# Waze_Churn_Prediction_Model
Google's Advanced Data Analytics Course Project

Goal: 
Develop a churn prediction model using Python to help prevent churn and improve user retention. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

Who are the users most likely to churn?

Why do users churn? 

When do users churn?

Generate insights that will help Waze optimize the companyâ€™s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.
